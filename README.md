<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="about">About the project</h2>

This app is designed to provide users with real-time weather information for any location they search for. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can easily check current weather conditions, temperature, and the local time in their chosen location.

<h2 id="goals">Goals and objectives</h2>

This project was undertaken as a practical exercise to deepen my understanding of front-end web development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
The development of Nimbus allowed me to gain hands-on experience in building a single-page application that consumes an external weather API to deliver real-time data.

Looking forward, I plan to enhance Nimbus by integrating additional features such as a 7-day weather forecast. These enhancements will provide users with a more comprehensive understanding of the weather in their selected locations, further improving the utility and user experience of the application.
